This is the repository to the Computational Intelligence Laboratory project of the group SentimentalGuys.
To reproduce our results we have written separate instruction README files in each branch.
Just clone the repository and check out the desired branch.
There are three branches:
  - mean_word_vector: check out this branch to reproduce the simple basline models and preprocessing methods
  - BERT: This branch contains the code to reproduce the DistilBERT result we report.
  - huggingface: Contains the ByT5 model and steps to reprodce the results.
